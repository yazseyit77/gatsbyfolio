After graduating from Flatiron school, I feel like I am lonely. Want to do something, keep up learning new tools, frameworks or even languages. I have always had passion in learning anything related Web applications. Here we go, I decided to build my own website that represents myself, that advertises me as a personal brand. I found an amazing tool to generate an easy website, named Jekyll. It is a Ruby gem, that generates a one HTML page static website that you can upload to any server. I hosted mine on GitHub, since they also offer a static website hosting for free.

Then, I found another outstanding tool, Gatsby. So what is Gatsby anyways? Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

So, what makes it so special that everyone is amazed by it? Well, Gatsby is a blazing fast modern site generator that is used for building static sites that are Progressive Web Apps. It follows the latest web standards, and is optimized to be highly functioning tool. It makes use of the latest and popular technologies including ReactJS, Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6 + JavaScript and CSS.

To be able to build a Website, you don’t have to be a developer. Once you follow through the splendid documentation, it walks you through by the steps of installation and generating your website. Then you can find a free template Gatsby theme and start manipulating the data according to your interest. To change the data to be your own, you are mostly working with Markdown files.

I will provide basic installation guide to whom it might help:

> Here is a quick [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-quick-start-with-gatsby-create-develop-and-build-gatsby-sites-from-the-command-line) guide for those who like watching and following through.

-   First step is installing the Gatsby CLI: **`"npm install -g gatsby-cli"`**

-   Second creating a new site using the command: **`"gatsby new project-name"`**

-   Then change the directory path into the project you created: **`"cd project-name"`**

-   And then run the command: **`"gatsby develop"`**

to start your website on localhost which will run on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Every time you make changes on any page, Gatsby will auto-reload the page and implement the changes for you. See, nice and easy!!

> The next step I will follow through is to find a host other than GitHub and store my Portfolio Website up and running with a real domain name. I will probably go with Netlify since it is a very popular cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for static websites. And that’s exactly what I need. Here is a quick snap of my Website:
