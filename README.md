# Personal Portfolio

Built by using the open source template:
**[Live Demo](https://elemental.netlify.com)** | **[Theme](https://github.com/akzhy/gatsby-theme-elemental)**

This portfolio is not intended for advertising any third party websites or products. It is built out of passion into web development graduate.

I have found this Elemental open source free template that is built by GatsbyJS and wanted to modify it according to my needs.

I have changed almost everything:

The "Home" page contains my full name and the jobs that I'm open to apply for.

The "About" page contains a short descriptive background about myself.

The "Blogs" page contains the blog posts that I have recently published.

The "Projects" page contains my latest 4 projects.

The "Contact" page has a form that you guys can reach out to me via email. And also there is my phone number and the city I live in.

Thank you so much the Elemental Team for creating such an amazing template.
